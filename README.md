# Starting

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alexmario74/rollup-hot-reload-boilerplate.git
cd rollup-hot-reload-boilerplate
npm istall
npm run serve
```

The project will start running on a localhost and could be accessed by browser.

If you edit the `src/main.js` file, you'll see your changes affecting the page as soon as you save the file.

The file include a dependency, just to show how to split code.

All modules have to be imported in `src/main.js` file in order to be avaialble (i.e. web components).

## Motivation

Just an easy project to start developing quick a front-end app.

## Typescript

If you prefere Typescript have a look to the branch `typescript`.
